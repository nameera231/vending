How to try out the Vending Machine:

1. The main method of the VendingMachineTester class will set up the
vending machine. Then, it allows users purchase sodas from the vending machine. To do this, the
main method uses the objects of the vending machine pieces explained above.
2. Test the class by simulating the following transactions:
• A successful purchase in which the user receives a soda. The user may (not) receive change
after the purchase.
• A purchase attempt that is unsuccessful because the stockpile does not contain any soda.

The main method inside the VendingMachineTester class creates an interactive interface that
reads in instructions from the terminal window, performs the requested operations on the vending
machine, and reports the results.
